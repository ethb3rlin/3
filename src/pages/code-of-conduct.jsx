      <p className="mt-2">
        We are a collective and we want to bring people in the community
        together to exchange ideas, make new friends, and build things as an
        inclusive, welcoming, and safe community.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Therefore, any harmful or discriminating behavior by anyone (volunteers,
        organizers, project leads, contributors, hackers, or absolutely anyone
        involved in our community) will not be tolerated and results in the
        offending person(s) being excluded from the group.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Members should be judged by their actions, not criteria such as degrees,
        age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity
        or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack
        thereof), or position. We are a diverse community. Leave your egos at
        the door.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Be Open</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        We welcome one and all. We especially love to adopt newbies in the
        community. We foster decentralized, open communities, society, and
        technology, so we should be open to everyone and everything. We all
        bring different backgrounds and experiences. Great things can happen
        when we show up with an open mind and curiosities to explore. If you
        don't have an open mind, this group is not for you.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Be Respectful</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Be exceptionally kind to others. Respect their work, time, and
        perspectives. Do not insult or troll others, unless it is for banter
        (covered in a later point). We all spend our time, resources, and energy
        to be part of this group. Respect each other, the projects, and the
        process.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Be Daring</h2>{" "}
      <p className="mt-2">
        Dare to create something nobody did before. If you get stuck, ask for
        help - people will help you when you ask. This is a community. We create
        things together.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">What We Create</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Promote Decentralization. Build what matters to you. You can organize
        events, build applications, or foster public discourse. You can create
        art and beauty on a computer. Most importantly, create, hack, and build
        together.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Contributions in Other Ways</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">Banter and memeing is encouraged as you see fit.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Personal Responsibility</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Everyone in this community is responsible for their own tasks. If you
        have a project, it is your responsibility to manage it. We are not here
        to spoon feed you or do your work for you. Ain't nobody got time for
        that. But we are a community and here to support. Always reach out if
        you are having issues with completing a task.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Unacceptable Behavior & Harassment</h2>{" "}
      <p className="mt-2">
        Unacceptable behavior includes: intimidation, harassment, abuse,
        discrimination, derogatory or demeaning words or actions by any
        participant in our community online or in person. If you have
        disagreements with someone, communicate directly with each other and
        work on a solution.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
        related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
        inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation
        slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation
        slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing
        photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
        inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Notify Us</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
        other concerns, you can always notify a project lead, event organizer,
        or member of the core group. Anytime. We will do everything to help and
        support you. If you can't find anyone in person, reach out via email:{" "}
