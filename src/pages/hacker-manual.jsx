          <p>
            Berlin has one airport called Berlin Brandenburg Airport "Willy
            Brandt" (BER) and is well connected with railway. You can take a
            train from European cities such as Amsterdam and Paris to travel
            with the convenience of comfortable high-speed trains with internet
            access, avoid the long security lines, missing luggages, and
            decrease your CO2 footprint. Check the{" "}

          <h3 className="text-xl">Urban Transport</h3>
          <p>
            Berlin is a bike friendly city. Most of the times the quickest and
            easiest way to getting from A to B is by bike. If you are staying
            longer than just a few days, you might want to consider renting a
            bike from <a href="https://swapfiets.de/en-DE/berlin">Swapfiets</a>.
            You will also find many scooters and bikes that you can grab around
            the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">Jelbi App</a> you can
            conveniently find the public transportation tickets and info as well
            as carsharing, scooters, bikes etc.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl">Accomodation</h3>
          <p>
            The hackathon has a nap room where you can rest, but not make it
            your home. Beanbags are provided, but sleeping bags are not allowed.
            If you want a good sleep, then you need to find somewhere else.

          <h3 className="text-xl">Open Track</h3>
          <p>
            The open-track prize is the main hackathon award. Every project is
            eligible, given they are respecting the hackathon rules. The open
            track will be judged by everyone attending the event. There will be
            no pitches and no judges. All the attendees can vote using their
            EtherCards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The winning project will be presenting at the closing ceremony and
            the prize is 10000 DAI. There is only one.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl">Track Awards</h3>
          <p>
            Track awards are based on covering specific topics. Each project can
            only submit to one track maximum. It is not possible to apply for
            multiple tracks!
          </p>
          <p>
            One team member pitches in front of the judges. The domain experts
            will evaluate the projects according to defined parameters. Judges
            will also review code and ensure hackathon rules are respected.
          </p>
          <p>These are the four tracks:</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl">Meta Awards</h3>
          <p>
            Meta awards reward certain aspects of your project. Every project is
            eligible, given you are respecting the hackathon rules. Projects
            should indicate which meta-award they think they qualify for in the
            submission form.

          <p>
            This year, we will use a different platform for your submissions. We
            decided not to use devpost for this edition, since they are sadly
            excluding participation from some regions by default. This
            discriminatory and overly compliant behavior is kind of a "no" for
            us, so instead we shall be collaborating with the much more
            decentralised crew at{" "}
            <a href="https://devfolio.co/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              Devfolio
            </a>
            .
          </p>

          <p>
            Each team will have one person pitch their project for 3 minutes
            followed by a 2 minutes Q&A session. The pitch will be in front
            of three judges each with different areas of exptertise.
            The presenter should bring their laptop and use it for the pitch.
            All judging will take place on the second floor. A schedule will be 
            shared after 11:30 Sunday. Please be there at least 5 minutes
            before your allocated timeslot. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We aim to continuously improve the process. This is why this year we
            will have three different approaches to judging:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              "Traditional judging": Judges watch live pitches & Judges check
              submissions async digitally
            </li>
            <li>Community judging powered by quadratic voting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, we also want to increase the transparency of the judging.
            This is why all judge voting sheets will be made publicly available
            after the winning ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judging will take place on Sunday 18th September and the judges will
            be reviewing project submissions, and watching pitches, from the
            11am deadline until just before the closing ceremony. Note: we will
            also be shuffling the judging teams halfway through just to make
            sure there is no relative bias.
          </p>

          <p>
            The track specific judges will watch live pitches, while the judges
            allocated to the meta awards will review the submissions digitally.
            There will be 24 track judges (8 groups of three), and each group
            will include one technical person, one product/wildcard and one
            business/VC judge.
          </p>

          <p>
            As mentioned above, the meta specific judges will review submissions
            digitally and there will be two pairs of judges per meta award.
          </p>

          <p>
            The judges will be reviewing each submission with the following
            criteria in mind.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Technicality: How hard was it to build this and how does the
              quality of the codebase compare? 
            </li>
            <li>
              Originality: Is this something completely new or are there 
              already projects with grant funding working on a similar scope?
            </li>
            <li>
              Practicality: How would this submission survive in the real world,
              outside of the crypto community? Or, if the project were to be
              specifically targeted to the crypto community, how correctly
              targeted is it?
            </li>
            <li>
             
            </li>
            <li>
              WOW Factor: What else is there about the
              submission? Has this project and/or team defied expectations,
              based on timing, efforts, etc.?
