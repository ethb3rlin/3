        <p>
          Berlin has one airport called Berlin Brandenburg Airport "Willy
          Brandt" (BER) and is well connected with railway. You can take a train
          from European cities such as Amsterdam and Paris to travel with the
          convenience of comfortable high-speed trains with internet access,
          avoid the long security lines, missing luggages, and decrease your CO2
          footprint. Check the{" "}

        <h3 className="text-xl">Urban Transport</h3>
        <p>
          Berlin is a bike friendly city. Most of the times the quickest and
          easiest way to getting from A to B is by bike. If you are staying
          longer than just a few days, you might want to consider renting a bike
          from <a href="https://swapfiets.de/en-DE/berlin">Swapfiets</a>. You
          will also find many scooters and bikes that you can grab around the
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">Jelbi App</a> you can
          conveniently find the public transportation tickets and info as well
          as carsharing, scooters, bikes etc.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl">Accomodation</h3>
        <p>
          The hackathon has a nap room where you can rest, but not make it your
          home. Beanbags are provided, but sleeping bags are not allowed. If you
          want a good sleep, then you need to find somewhere else.
        </p>

          Aside from hotels and AirBnbs, you can try to find someone in Berlin
          renting out temporarily for cheaper options. You can check{" "}
          <a href="https://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/">WG-Gesucht</a> and Facebook
          groups for offers and can place your own request post there. However,
          please be wary of the risks and potential scams.

          We recommend the districts Treptow, Kreuzberg, Neuk&ouml;lln, or
          Friedrichshain due to their proximity to the venue.

          should indicate which meta-award they think they qualify for in the
          submission form.

          There will be no pitches and our judges will review submissions
          asynchronously during the track award pitching.
