        ETHBerlin続 is a hackathon and cultural festival that is entirely
        organized by the Berlin Ethereum, Cosmos, and Polkadot community. We are
        neither seeking profits nor are a professional event-production company.
        Everything we create during the event is entirely ideated by our friends
        and contributors, and the whole event is only made possible by the
        countless volunteers that make it happen.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Mentor</h2>
      <p>
        Many hackers at ETHBerlin続 are newcomers to the space. As a mentor, you
        share your extensive knowledge about infrastructure, protocols,
        decentralized applications, smart contracts, crypto-economics, security,
        privacy, product design, strategy or other magic skills with the
        participants of the hackathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentors can be reached through an internal ticketing system and will be
        easy to identify by their special swag.
